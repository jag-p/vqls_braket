    "# How to solve systems of linear equations on a near-term quantum computer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will be using [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) to implement and run the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) algorithm with the goal to solve an $8\\times8$ system of linear equations. Later, you will run your PennyLane code on [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) in the cloud to solve a larger system of size $1024\\times1024$.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In many applications in science and technology, we are interested in finding a solution for a [system of $N$ linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{N} a_{1j} x_j = b_1 \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{N} a_{Nj} x_j = b_N\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_1,\\cdots,x_N$ are the unknown variables to be solved for and $a_{ij}$ and $b_1,\\cdots,b_N$ are known coefficients. If we arrange $a_{ij}$ in an $N\\times N$ matrix $A$, $x_i$ and $b_i$ into column vectors ${\\bf x}$ and ${\\bf b}$ then we can rewrite the linear system above as $$A{\\bf x}={\\bf b}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems of this type are frequently encountered when solving differential equations, performing linear regression and curve-fitting, in various combinatorial applications, and in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum vs classical\n",
    "\n",
    "Since systems of linear equations are encountered in physics, chemistry, differential equations, and other areas many classical techniques have been developed to solve them. One of the oldest is [Cramer's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule), which is inefficient because it requires computing many [matrix determinants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant). Another is [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination), which only needs one determinant to be computed, and has a complexity of $O(N^3)$ where $N$ is the number of equations. Beyond these techniques there are many \"numerical\" (e.g. computational) methods for these problems. There is a whole field, [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) devoted to solving them because of their many applications in transportation planning, logistics, and other optimization problems. The classical complexity of solving a system of linear equations can depend on precise details of $A$, the matrix encoding the problem, but in the worst case techniques like Gaussian elimination with pivoting are used, which are $O(N^3)$. Alternatively, an initial solution is proposed and then iteratively improved upon using the diagonal and off-diagonal components -- this is the [Jacobi method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method) but cannot be used for arbitrary $A$. For large $N$ this is unfavorable and so a quantum algorithm with better scaling would be attractive for such tasks.\n",

    "### Solving linear systems with quantum computers\n",
    "\n",
    "The possibility of solving linear systems on quantum computers has received considerable attention through the proposal of [Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd](https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3171) (HHL) originally in 2008, which is one of the main fundamental algorithms expected to provide an exponential speedup  over their classical counterparts (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HHL_algorithm). While the HLL quantum algorithm holds promise for the future, when large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers exist, the timescale for such computers to become available remains an open question.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting alternative strategy to solve systems of linear equations on currenlty available noisy itermediate-scale (NISQ) quantum computers is to employ a **variational** hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. These algorithms work by using the quantum computer for the part of the calculation that is hardest for the classical computer, while minimizing the total number of quantum operations as compared to doing everything on the quantum device.\n",

    "To solve the problem, VQLS employs an initial solution for the gate sequence $V({\\bf \\alpha})$ that prepares a potential solution $|x({\\bf \\alpha})\\rangle = V({\\bf \\alpha})|0\\rangle$. The parameters $\\bf \\alpha$ are classical inputs to a quantum computer which estimates a cost function $C({\\bf \\alpha})$ which quantifies the closeness of the quantum states $A|x(\\alpha)\\rangle$ and $|b\\rangle$. The value of $C({\\bf \\alpha})$ is returned to a **classical** computer which iteratively adjusts $\\bf \\alpha$ in a classical optimization to minimize the cost. This continues until a termination condition is reached for $\\alpha = \\alpha_{\\text{opt}}$. This interplay between classical and quantum operations is what makes the algorithm \"hybrid\". Finally, the output parameters $\\alpha_{\\text{opt}}$ can be used to prepare the solution state $|x(\\alpha_{\\text{opt}})\\rangle = V(\\alpha_{\\text{opt}})|0\\rangle$. \n",

This would not be possible if we wouldn't use a local quantum circuit simulator like PennyLane's [Lightning Qubit](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/lightning/en/v0.25.0/devices.html) device but [real quantum hardware or a managed simulator on Braket](https://amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devices/braket_remote.html). But what is with the classical part of our algorithm? Do we want to continue running it interactively in this notebook if we are offloading quantum tasks to the cloud? And what if we want to scale up and test our algorithm with a larger linear system of equations which requires more classical compute capacity and results in longer overall execution time, as well? Finally, what if we want to make sure we can track and durably store different versions of our algorithm code and hyperparameter configurations to ensure reproduceablility for the experiments we run while we develop and benchmark our algorithm?\n",

    "Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs enables you to run hybrid quantum-classical algorithms requiring both classical AWS resources and quantum processing units conveniently in a high-performance cloud environment providing the following main benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance:** Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs provides better performance than running hybrid algorithms from your own environment. While your job is running, it has priority access to the selected target QPU. Tasks from your job run ahead of other tasks queued on the device. This results in shorter and more predictable runtimes for hybrid algorithms. Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs also supports parametric compilation. You can submit a circuit using free parameters and Braket compiles the circuit once, without the need to recompile for subsequent parameter updates to the same circuit, resulting in even faster runtimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convenience:** Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs simplifies setting up and managing your compute environment and keeping it running while your hybrid algorithm runs. You just provide your algorithm script and select a quantum device (either a quantum processing unit or a simulator) on which to run. Amazon Braket waits for the target device to become available, spins up the classical resources, runs the workload in pre-built or self-defined container environments, returns the results to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and releases the compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics:** Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs provides on-the-fly insights into running algorithms and delivers customizable algorithm metrics in near real-time to Amazon CloudWatch and the Amazon Braket console so you can track the progress of your algorithms.\n",
